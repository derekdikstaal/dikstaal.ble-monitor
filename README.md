Heltec ESP32 V3 Lora - Multiple BLE device monitor. 

This code was written for our camper to display information from multiple BLE devices.
In this case two batteries and a water level sensor.

The code scans and connects to three pre-defined BLE devices simultaneously.
Scanning continues until all devices are found.
